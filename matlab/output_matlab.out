Notice from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `tran'.
    GminDC = 1 pS is large enough to noticeably affect the DC solution.
        dV(I17.net_0) = -10.7209 mV
        Use the `gmin_check' option to eliminate or expand this report.
    I19.C1: Initial condition computed between nodes I19.net14 and I19.Vin_comp
        is in error by 3.2817 uV.
    I19.C0: Initial condition computed between nodes Vout_sf0 and I19.net14 is
        in error by 3.28187 uV.
        Decrease `rforce' to reduce error in computed initial conditions. 
        However, setting rforce too small may result in convergence
        difficulties or in the matrix becoming singular.
